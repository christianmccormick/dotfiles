# dotfiles

A collection of my personal dotfiles that I use to configure my development environment, and set up my machines.

## Installation

Run the following, replacing `environment` with `work` or `personal`, depending on the kind of install being performed.

```
git clone https://github.com/christianmccormick/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh -e [environment]
```
